# Chat Server

A simple chat server and client system that allows users to send and receive messages. The server handles multiple clients, broadcasting messages to all connected users.

## Dependencies

- SFML 2.6.2
- C++11
- g++

Additionally, the chat server relies on **port 53000** being open on your router. You may need to set up **port forwarding** on your router to allow users on other networks to connect to the server.
