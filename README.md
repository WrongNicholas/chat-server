## Chat Server

A simple chat server and client system that allows users to send and receive messages. 

## Dependencies

- SFML 2.6.2
- C++11
- g++

## Additional Notes

Additionally, the chat server relies on **port 53000** being open on your router. 

You will need to set up **port forwarding** on your router to allow users on other networks to connect to your server.
